# DIMORA

**DIMORA** (**DI**ffusion **MO**dels **R** **A**nalysis) is a statistical package that allows the analysis of diffusion data using different models, among the most used and useful.
The need for this package arises from the lack of a similar tool in R, the idea is therefore to provide a platform that allows the most in-depth analysis of the diffusion data.
