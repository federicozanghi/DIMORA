Description: The implemented methods are: Bass model, Generalized Bass model (with rectangular shock, exponential shock, mixed shock and harmonic shock, 1 to 3 shocks available), Dynamic market potential model, and UCRCD model. The Bass model consists of a simple differential equation that describes the process of how new products get adopted in a population, the Generalized Bass model is a generalization of the Bass model with a function x(t), capturing the changing speed of diffusion. In some real processes the market potential may be not constant over time and a dynamic market potential model is needed. The Guseo-Guidolin model is a specification of this situation. The UCRCD model (Unbalanced Competition and Regime Change Diachronic) is a diffusion model used to capture the dynamics of competition between two products within the same market.
